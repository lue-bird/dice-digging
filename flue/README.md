## ideas

- view area gets bigger for higher speeds
- waiting â†’ impatience as a mechanic
- based on stamina, hunger, thirst, damage, emotion, ... as a mechanic
    - failed/opposite/bad/wrong actions
    - perspective (rotation, field of view, height, colors, screen shake, blur, ...)
- being stripped of unique aspects
- when landing on an object, everything else collapses
- shadows growing ever longer oe changing side
- randomly objects have a label attached like: "a tree" or "water" or "it's a rock"
- resetting <BIRD>'s position
- adaptive music with microtonal drips on flap
- <LIVING> reappearing even though you've just met them
- when first sit on branch:
  is it just just me or has my home's population just increased?
    - <BIRD> [no options] people don't reply to rhetorical Qs.
- Trees turning like wind wheels in the wind
- dialogue
    - dialog options for characters <BIRD> speaks with
    - https://www.emotes.io/?unicode
    - repeated transitions, like _ ___ da daa da, da-dam!_

          just play the game. the chatting is ruining the pace
          _>u<      yeey!_
        - <BIRD>
          _let's finish bfore brain â†’ mush_
          i must finish this first!
          _i must start by saying the following:_
    - <SQUID>
      _<(ï¿£ï¸¶ï¿£)>_
      squid appears as a mouth and two eyes colored pink
      you are a bird, and I am a god, capable of predicting every move you will make
      having simulated entire universes, millions of them in fact
      
      there is only 1 rule in this universe:
      the better an organism is in staying in existence, the longer it will stay in existence

      this is why you   exist, this is why i          exist
      this is why pain exists, this is why happiness exists

      nervous systems and the connected pain in your brain 
        - <BIRD> get to the point
        - <SQUID>
          with everyone's causes of wellbeing defined by evolution
          we can only bring more happiness through artificial stimulation
        - <BIRD> and there are no problems with that
        - <SQUID> yes, there are no problems with that
        - <BIRD>
          so your point is, that simply viewing living beings through such a simplified lens is harmful?
          that people that are only stimulated all their life could feel some other sense of emptiness inside

          like people only feeling happy
          when they are important or have contributed to society
        - <SQUID>
          oh yeah there are things that feel less "empty" to humans bc of their evolutionary value
          the implications are for desert later
          _.//._
    - rule of thumb
      for every viewpoint you adapt you must be able to define a line where you step back from it
      otherwise it becomes like a religion and you like a useful tool
      
    - characters know your given name and other information,
      even if you haven't even talked to them
    - pointless sentences
        - i just simply tell you what i say!
        - you drink drinks
        - you eat food
        - you are here
        - can i see you?
        - can i hear you?
        - when is now     ?
        - i just know what i know
        - i'm <OPP>. Do you know your name?

        - _89 seconds       i like that one_
        - _Next, commercials_
    - <FOM>
        anyway, rubbish, i mean <BIRD>, TODO
        _â€¢â€¿â€¢_
        - <BIRD> were you about to call me rubbish right there?
        - <FOM> what are you saying? don't accuse me of something i wouldn't do
        - <FOM> TODO scary shit

    - thought: stories about traveling back in time to not fix mistakes only to find out good things were caused by bad happening
    - because of fear: time-travel as little as possible
    - realization: the same applies to you right now
    - realization: impact of actions must be undermined by an equal amount of proof/knowledge
    - ok, step back, easier terms
      most actions cause harm even if they bring a lot of happiness as well
      some actions necessarily cause harm which will keep the world from being rid of non-happiness
      examples welcome
      you pay for the time of humans
      which they don't live fully as they please
      r u stupid not everyone can do as they please as this would be the end of society
      yes
      can you think of unnecessary things tho
      i tried but my happiness is worth more than the paid persons restrictions
      probably    sometimes not
      means we should

        - colors like _yellow_, _black_, _grey_ (the blandest and most deep color of all)
        - too short on screen to read fully, not repeatable, to make you kind of frustrated you missed the lore
        - sometimes _~_ wave if no thoughts
    - one of the first thoughts displays a longer text for a short time:
        _fine, you win. what a cheap move, watching this recorded gameplay|||_
        _you'll always find| this| stuff |out| way after I said it, though_
    - _i wish you could help me find the present I lost_
        - <BIRD> give present
        - why are you reading my thoughts? It's really uncomfortable you know!
            - <BIRD> disable / keep enabled
    - <BIRD> what was the task <OPP> mentioned you had to do?
        - _I said the line I prepared for this scenario just according to the book_
        - <OPP> that has nothing to do with you, does it?
        _ <BIRD> silence, huh? | It's like you just read lines off a script

        - <BIRD> can fend off eating others multiple times
        - <BIRD> only comes to know <BIRD> has eaten multiple others later
          oh
          
          that's brutally sad
          no matter what i do i hurt others more than i bring happiness


          and didn't i end a ton of lives just by having lived up until this point?
          _?_
